			<h3 class="artificial">What is Artificial Intelligent....?</h3>
			<p>Before the year 2000, this could have been explained as a computer doing something better than a human. After the year 2000, the definition of AI was changed to where AI is an intelligence that is on par or beyond that of humans. Samuel’s checkers’ program is a perfect example of this. Created by Arthur Samuel, this was a Checkers game that had no knowledge of Checkers. But over time, it learned and got better.</p>
			<p>From there, people also idolized AI as the one-stop thing that could end all their problems. People are now focusing on using AI to understand what they say and to get machines to respond accordingly. They are also utilizing technologies such as image recognition so that a machine can understand the components and context of an image and make decisions accordingly. An example of this would be smart security cameras where it can detect shoplifters from the way they move.
			In the postmodern era that we’re in now, learning has become a dominant underlying technology. It is applied across a number of various fields and genres such as personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis and web search. One of the main showcases of this is from IBM Watson when it played Jeopardy.</p>
