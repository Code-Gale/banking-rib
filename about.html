				<p>Approximately 90% of data in the world has been generated within just the last two years. But what is the point of all this data if we cannot process it? “This the challenge for data scientists today,” said Prof. Nirmalie Wiratunga at the at the recently held Big Data Forum for Data Enthusiasts organized by Informatics Institute of Technology.
				In her presentation at the event, Prof. Nirmalie explained that data scientists have to go through vast amounts of data and then learn how to process it. But it’s not just about figuring out what data is relevant or obsolete, but rather to figure out how to curate it.
				In digital health, for example, a person can generate a Million GB of data throughout his/her lifetime. That’s the equivalent of 300 million books. The goal here is to map out a person’s health and see how one person’s data can help prolong the health of millions of other people.
